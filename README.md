# COBO AI
Cobo AI is a specialized tool designed to map and visualize chat sessions with a large language model (LLM) in a graph view. It organizes these discussions into Realms—dedicated spaces that contain and map all LLM chat sessions related to the same topic or problem the user is working on, providing an intuitive, interconnected view of the conversation landscape
